## PART 1: IXP Operator Training (Internal Team)

**Goal:** Transform generalist network engineers into IXP Specialists capable of troubleshooting BGP, managing Linux servers, and handling hardware failures.

### Phase 1: Foundation Knowledge (Self-Paced)
Before touching the live equipment, operators must complete these prerequisites. We utilize existing high-quality resources to save cost.

*   **Routing Security:**
    *   Course: **MANRS Implementation Guide** (Free).
    *   Key Skill: Understanding why RPKI and Anti-Spoofing matter.
*   **BGP Operations:**
    *   Course: **APNIC Academy - BGP Basics & Advanced BGP**.
    *   Key Skill: AS-Path manipulation, Communities, Attributes.
*   **Linux/System Administration:**
    *   Resource: **Ubuntu Server Guide**.
    *   Key Skill: SSH key management, Systemd services, Cron jobs, Docker basics.

### Phase 2: The PacIXP Tech Stack (Hands-On)
Training on the specific tools deployed at PacIXP.

*   **IXP Manager Admin:**
    *   **Activity:** Create a dummy member, assign ports, generate a Route Server config.
    *   **Outcome:** Understanding the "Source of Truth" workflow.
*   **Switching Fabric (Arista/Juniper):**
    *   **Activity:** Break/Fix labs. Admin down a port, recover from a bad config paste, troubleshoot a transceiver error.
    *   **Outcome:** Confidence in the CLI.
*   **Route Server (BIRD):**
    *   **Activity:** Read the `bird.conf` generated by IXP Manager. Trace why a route is being rejected (e.g., RPKI Invalid).
    *   **Outcome:** Ability to debug "Why can't I see Member X's routes?"

### Phase 3: Operational Drills ("Game Days")
Conducted quarterly. The senior engineer introduces a fault; the junior team must fix it.

1.  **Scenario A: The Dead Route Server.**
    *   *Simulated:* Shut down BIRD on RS1.
    *   *Goal:* Verify RS2 handles traffic. Check Looking Glass. Restart BIRD.
2.  **Scenario B: The Rogue Member.**
    *   *Simulated:* A test port floods the fabric with Broadcast traffic.
    *   *Goal:* Identify the port via Storm Control counters and shut it down.
3.  **Scenario C: Database Corruption.**
    *   *Simulated:* IXP Manager DB is "corrupted."
    *   *Goal:* Restore from the nightly backup.

## PART 2: IXP Member Onboarding (The Customer)

**Goal:** Minimize friction for ISPs and Content Providers joining the exchange.

### The "Welcome Pack" (Documentation)
Every new member receives a PDF/Wiki link containing:
1.  **Addressing:** Their assigned IPv4/IPv6 and ASN details.
2.  **Technical Specs:**
    *   Allowed Ethertypes (0x0800, 0x86dd, 0x0806).
    *   MTU Settings (1500 or 9000).
    *   Security requirements (No Proxy ARP, No CDP/LLDP).
3.  **Config Snippets:** Copy-paste examples for Cisco IOS, Juniper, and MikroTik (very common in the Pacific).

### The Onboarding Workflow

#### Step 1: Administrative (Day 0-2)
*   Member signs **MOU (Memorandum of Understanding)**.
*   Member requests port size (1G/10G) via IXP Manager Portal.
*   **PacIXP Team:** Assigns VLAN ID and IP Addresses in IPAM.

#### Step 2: Physical Connection (Day 3)
*   Member runs cross-connect (fiber) to the PacIXP ODF.
*   **PacIXP Team:** Patches to the switch.
*   **Verification:** Check Light Levels (`show interfaces transceiver`).

#### Step 3: Quarantine & Hygiene Check (Day 4)
**CRITICAL STEP:** The port is placed in `VLAN 999` (Quarantine) initially.

*   **The Mac Check:** Ensure only 1 MAC address is visible.
*   **The Chatter Check:** Run `tcpdump` on the port.
    *   *Fail:* Seeing STP BPDUs, OSPF Hellos, or MNDP (MikroTik Discovery).
    *   *Pass:* Only ARP and BGP traffic seen.
*   *Only after passing is the port moved to `VLAN 10` (Production).*

#### Step 4: BGP Session Establishment (Day 5)
*   Member configures BGP to peer with RS1 and RS2.
*   **PacIXP Team:** Verifies session state in IXP Manager.
*   **PacIXP Team:** Checks "Hidden Routes" in BIRD to ensure the member isn't sending Bogons or RPKI Invalids.

#### Step 5: Go Live (Day 5)
*   Routes are accepted.
*   Traffic begins flowing.
*   Member is announced on the PacIXP mailing list.

## PART 3: Support & Troubleshooting Guide

A clear matrix for who does what.

### Support Channels
1.  **NOC Email:** `noc@pacixp.net` (Ticketing System).
2.  **Emergency Phone:** `+679-XXX-XXXX` (Critical outages only).
3.  **Slack/WhatsApp Group:** Community chat for informal peer support.

### Common Member Issues & Fixes

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Port Down (Physical)** | Bad Fiber / Incompatible Optics. | Check light levels. Flip TX/RX strands. Hard code speed/duplex (rare). |
| **BGP Idle** | ACL blocking port 179 / Wrong Password. | Check switch ACLs. Verify MD5 secret. Check Member logs. |
| **Routes Rejected** | RPKI Invalid / IRR Missing. | Member must create ROA (APNIC portal) or update PeeringDB/RADB. |
| **MAC Violation** | Swapping Routers. | **Admin:** Clear port-security on switch. **Member:** Use configured MAC. |

## PART 4: Community Building Strategy

An IXP is 10% technology and 90% trust.

1.  **Peering Socials:**
    *   Annual meetup (perhaps aligned with PITA AGM).
    *   Beer/Food provided.
    *   Goal: Engineers from competing ISPs meet face-to-face. *Handshakes enable peering.*
2.  **Technical Workshops:**
    *   Invite APNIC/NSRC trainers once a year.
    *   Topic: "BGP Filtering," "IPv6 Deployment," or "Network Security."
    *   Open to all members.
3.  **Mailing List:**
    *   `ops@pacixp.net`: For operational announcements (maintenance).
    *   `public@pacixp.net`: For general discussion.

## 5. Certification & Compliance
To maintain standards, PacIXP will implement a **"Certified Peer"** badge.

*   **Bronze:** Connected and Peering.
*   **Silver:** PeeringDB profile complete + NOC contacts updated.
*   **Gold (MANRS):** RPKI ROAs created + Anti-spoofing enabled.

*This encourages members to improve their own network hygiene gamification.*
